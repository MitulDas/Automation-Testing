# Automation-Testing

## Overview
A practice automation test framework for Amazon.com, based on the knowledge gained as a first-year automation engineer at Fitbit-Boston. This project is a sample project to practice designing automated test frameworks.

## Problems
One of the key challenges faced during the development of this framework was the inability to set up tests to run in parallel. This limitation stemmed from an initial design oversight in `DriverUtils`. Despite efforts, a solution for this issue hasn't been found yet.
